# Notes on Performance Metrics and Imbalance Mitigation

## Performance Metrics

When dealing with imbalanced datasets, accuracy can be misleading as it may disproportionately reflect the performance on the majority class. Instead, we should evaluate model performance using the following metrics:

- **Precision**: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
  - Formula: `Precision = TP / (TP + FP)`
- **Recall**: Also known as sensitivity, it focuses on identifying all positive cases.
  - Formula: `Recall = TP / (TP + FN)`
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the trade-off between the two.
- **Precision-Recall (P-R) Curve**: A graphical representation of the trade-off between precision and recall across different thresholds.

These metrics provide better insights into model performance, especially for the minority classes.

## Imbalance Mitigation Techniques

To address dataset imbalance, the following techniques can be employed:

1. **Resampling**:
   - **Oversampling the Minority Classes**: 
     - Use methods like **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to create synthetic samples for minority classes, effectively balancing the dataset.
   - **Undersampling the Majority Class**: 
     - Reduce the size of the majority class to match the minority classes. While this can help balance the data, it risks losing valuable information from the majority class.  
     - **Recommendation for Our Use Case**: Since "Firearm" is the majority class and contains important information, oversampling the minority classes is preferred over undersampling "Firearm" as not to loose information in it.

2. **Increasing Class Weights**:
   - Assign higher weights to minority classes in the model's loss function to penalize misclassifications for these classes more heavily.

## Way Forward

To determine the best approach, we propose the following steps:

1. **Baseline Training**:
   - Train the model using the dataset in its current form (without applying any resampling techniques).
   
2. **Resampling and Comparison**:
   - Apply oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) to balance the dataset and train the model on the modified data. This should be done on the training set only.
   - Compare the results of the baseline model and the resampled model using performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and the P-R curve.

This comparison will provide insights into the effectiveness of imbalance mitigation techniques for our specific use case.
